# These next settings affect the interaction between comfort and revenue in Simutrans. Comfort only
# affects passenger traffic, for obvious reasons. Passengers have a certain level of comfort that
# they will tolerate for certain distances. All comfort ratings are in the range of between 0 and
# 255. At the tolerable level, the revnue is unaffected. At above the tolerable level, a luxury
# bonus is applied. At below the tolerable level, a discomfort penalty is applied. The values can
# be set to anything, but, to reflect real life, it is suggested that the discomfort penalty is
# significantly higher than the luxury bonus. 
#
# tolerable_comfort_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle (0 - 255) for a journey of no
# more than tolerable_comfort_short_minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_short minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_median is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_median minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_long is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_long minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_long is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of at least
# tolerable_comfort_long minutes.
#
# For any journeys of a time between any of the values, a scaled proportion is taken. 
# 
# Note that (versions 7.2 onwards), the impact of comfort on revenue decreases with journey time.
# It is at its maximum level down to tolerable_comfort_median_long_minutes, after which it gradually
# reduces to 20% of its maximum at tolerable_comfort_short_minutes, and does not decrease further
# thereafter.

# max_luxury_bonus_differential is the maximum number of comfort rating points above the tolerable level
# that affects the luxury bonus. Anything beyond that, and further added luxury makes no difference to the
# revenue.
#
# max_luxury_bonus_percent is the percentage increase in revenue from the maximum level of luxury specified in
# max_luxury_bonus_differential. So, if the tolerable comfort level for any given travelling time was 100, the 
# max_luxury_bonus_differential 50, and the max_luxury_bonus_percent 50, then the revenue would increase up to
# 50% beyond the normal revenue for additional comfort up to 150, but would not increase further with any increase
# in comfort beyond 150.

# These settings control the revenue that can be earned from catering and travelling post offices. Note that catering
# vehicles on a convoy also increase the comfort by a small amount, which has an indirect effect on the revenue. These
# settings do not affect that: these settings affect the revenue earned from the catering itself: i.e., by selling food
# and drink. 
#
# catering_min_minutes is the shortest journey time that will provide any catering revenue. Anything below that, and 
# passengers will not bother to buy any food or drink at all. 
#
# catering_level1_minutes is the journey time at which any convoy with a catering level of 1 or higher will earn, per
# passenger, the number of Simu-cents (1/100th of a Simucredit) specified in catering_level1_max_revenue. 
# 
# The same applies for each subsequent catering level: in other words, higher catering levels only earn more than lower
# catering levels on journeys of at least the catering_levelX_minutes (where X is the catering level in question).
#
# Between each level, the a scaled proportion is applied. So, for example, if catering_min_minutes is 100, 
# catering_level1_minutes is 200, and the actual journey time is 150 minutes, then, any convoy with a catering level 
# of at least 1 will earn 50% of the amount specified in catering_level1_max_revenue per passenger.
